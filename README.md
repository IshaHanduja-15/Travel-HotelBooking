# Travel-HotelBooking

, The business idea for this implementation is to bridge the gap between service providers (Suppliers – Ex- indigo, Lemon Tree … etc ) and 
service receivers (Consumers - Users). 
 Service Receivers (Consumers) can book Flight Tickets & Hotels. They can avail all these 
services via placing an booking through the Mobile App / Portal. 
o Create a Login for the application and after successful login, User can do the Flight 
Search & Hotel Search. 
o If the type is Flight, Search should have all input parameters as Departure Location, 
Arrival Location, Flight Class (Economy/Business)., Flight Date. 
o If the type is Hotel, Search should have all input parameters as Hotel Name, City, 
Check In Date, Check Out Date Output. 
o Once Search is triggered after specifying the search parameters, It will display the 
search results. 
o User can then book the respective flights and hotels
